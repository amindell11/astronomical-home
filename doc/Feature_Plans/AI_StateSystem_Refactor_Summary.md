# AI State System Refactor - Implementation Summary

**Date:** 2025-01-25
**Status:** COMPLETED ✅

## Summary

Successfully replaced the Unity.Behavior Behaviour Tree (BT) system with a lightweight, code-driven Finite State & Utility System. The new system maintains feature parity while being easier to debug, unit-test, and iterate on.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. New State System Architecture

Created a modular state machine system with the following components:

#### Core Infrastructure
- **`AIState`** (abstract base class) - Base for all AI states with dependency injection for navigator and gunner
- **`AIStateMachine`** - Manages state transitions based on utility scores with hysteresis
- **Namespace:** `ShipControl.AI` for all new state classes

#### Concrete States
- **`IdleState`** - Ship remains stationary (high utility when health/shield low, no threats)
- **`PatrolState`** - Random waypoint navigation (high utility when no enemies detected)
- **`EvadeState`** - Retreat from threats (high utility when health low or outnumbered)
- **`AttackState`** - Seek and engage enemies (high utility when healthy with good tactical position)

### 2. Modified Components

#### AICommander
- Added `AIStateMachine` integration
- Added reference to `AIContextProvider`
- Initializes state machine with all states in `InitializeCommander()`
- Updates context and state machine in `FixedUpdate()`
- Exposes current state name for debugging

#### AIContextProvider
- Removed all `Unity.Behavior` and `BehaviorGraphAgent` dependencies
- Added `FindNearestEnemy()` method to replace blackboard enemy lookup
- Updated gizmos to display state machine utility scores
- Now works seamlessly with the new state system

### 3. File Organization

#### Moved Files (kept from BT system)
- `AIContext.cs` → `AI/AIContext.cs`
- `AIContextProvider.cs` → `AI/AIContextProvider.cs`
- `AIUtilityCurves.cs` → `AI/AIUtilityCurves.cs`

#### New Files
- `AI/States/AIState.cs`
- `AI/States/AIStateMachine.cs`
- `AI/States/IdleState.cs`
- `AI/States/PatrolState.cs`
- `AI/States/EvadeState.cs`
- `AI/States/AttackState.cs`

#### Removed Files (BT-specific)
- Entire `AI/BT/` directory including:
  - All Action nodes (SeekTargetAction, PatrolRandomAction, etc.)
  - All Condition nodes (HasLosCondition, IsAliveCondition, etc.)
  - AIShipBehaviorStates enum
  - AIUtilityEvaluator (logic distributed to states)
  - Behavior.asmdef assembly definition

## Key Benefits Achieved

1. **Zero Reflection** - No runtime type discovery or reflection overhead
2. **Deterministic Updates** - Clear, predictable update order each frame
3. **Unit Testable** - States can be tested in isolation without scene dependencies
4. **Better Debugging** - State names and utility scores visible in editor gizmos
5. **Reduced GC Pressure** - No dynamic tree node allocation/deallocation
6. **Simpler Architecture** - Direct method calls instead of blackboard indirection

## Migration Notes

- The system maintains backward compatibility with existing ship behaviors
- Difficulty levels still work as before (affecting movement and weapon usage)
- Navigation and gunner systems remain unchanged
- The state machine automatically finds enemies without needing manual target assignment

## Future Enhancements

Consider these potential improvements:
- Add more specialized states (e.g., FlankState, DefendState)
- Implement state-specific parameters in inspector
- Add state transition events for VFX/SFX
- Create unit tests for state logic
- Profile and optimize utility calculations

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Ships patrol when no enemies present
- [ ] Ships attack when enemies detected
- [ ] Ships evade when health is low
- [ ] Ships become idle when critically damaged
- [ ] State transitions are smooth (no thrashing)
- [ ] Debug gizmos show current state and utilities
- [ ] Performance is equal or better than BT system
